Above me is the game's name.
All war is deception.
Because reality is overrated.
Because you prefer chaos.
Because you were bored.
Disclaimer: The 'Playground' doesn't contain any playgrounds.
Find my pages.
I don't remember being here.
It's not Minecraft.
It's not Terraria.
Pretend this is a funny splash text.
Rule 1: No spamming in general chat.
Made with all the love I'm legally allowed to give.
My name is Mr. Text, Splash Text.
No, this is not Minecraft.
No, this is not Stardew Valley.
No, this is not Terraria.
Not responsible for lost hours.
Okay.
Remember to blink occasionally.
The fog is coming.
Things don't make sense.
This is a facade, the game is still loading.
To be continued.
Work in progress, maybe.
You may call me Breaking.

Ellipses...
Hmm...
Learning calculus for delta timing...
Maurice walks...
More ellipses... more...
Respawning in 3... 2... 1...
Uhh...
Waiting...
What if I change it to a 4...

...or is it?
Am I real?
Are you real?
Can you play the game please?
Do you have what it takes?
Do you want to play a game?
Is this a question?
Is this the whole game?
It works?
Hmm?
How do I exit?
What's up doc?
Who are you?
Who wrote me?
Who's that person sitting in that tree?
Would you be my neighbor?
